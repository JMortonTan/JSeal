**Test with Bitmap files (.bmp) resulted in no artifacts. And decoded successfully**
**Test with PNG files (.png) resulted in no artifacts. And decoded successfully**

### To Do List
- Implement File2Hex method in WorkingFile class
- Replace pixels in file based on blocks.
- Implement decode regimen, (How to indicate the end of a file has been retrieved?)


- Reorganize Class methods to better utilize Object Oriented Programming
- Implement "Block" colour averaging to better hide alterations to the naked eye.
