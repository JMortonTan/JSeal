JSeal
====================

###About

JSeal is a Steganography application that allows a user to encode data into an existing .JPEG file.

As of 10/14/2014, the source code contained in the folder 'Old' of this repository is the only running demo that has major bugs in its decoding methods.

I am in the process of rewriting the entire code.

**The code compiles!  But running decode command throws errors.**
**Also encoding doesn't seem to be working, although program successfully completes.**
**Last update: 10/20/14**

###To Do List
- Create UML diagram of program.
- Fix thrown errors.
- Finish CodedImage methods.
- JFrame GUI?
- Android GUI?
- Open source licensing.
